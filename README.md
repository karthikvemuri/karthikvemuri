![Design, Develop and have fun!]

Hey! I am Karthik, a Senior Software Developer. I have worked across a bunch of tech spaces - telecom, storage, networking. I've had a chance to work on Backend dev and low-level system programming. 

Right now, I'm diving into the fintech world as part of my role at Varo Money,  and exploring new tech. My GitHub's been on a long break, but I'm finally revamping it with fresh learning and experiments.

Skills: Python / JAVA / C++
